Stock MLP Classifier - Setup Instructions

1. Prerequisites:
   - Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system
   - pip (Python package manager)

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):
   Open a terminal/command prompt and run:

    On Windows:
        python -m venv stock_mlp_env
        stock_mlp_env\Scripts\activate
    
    On macOS/Linux:
        python3 -m venv stock_mlp_env
        source stock_mlp_env/bin/activate

3. Install Required Packages:
   With your virtual environment activated, run:
        pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

4. Prepare Your Data:
- Ensure you have two CSV files ready:
  1) Training data (e.g., 'train_data.csv')
  2) Test data (e.g., 'test_data.csv')
- Each CSV should contain these columns at minimum:
  ['Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', 'Output']
- The 'Output' column should be binary (0 or 1) indicating the prediction target

5. Run the Classifier:
- Save the provided Python script as 'stock_mlp.py'
- Run the program with:
        python stock_mlp.py
- When prompted:
  - Enter a random seed number (e.g., 42)
  - Provide the path to your training data CSV
  - Provide the path to your test data CSV

6. Expected Output:
- The program will display training progress every 100 epochs
- After training completes, it will show:
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
  - Final accuracy score

7. Troubleshooting:
- If you get package errors, ensure your virtual environment is activated
- For file not found errors, check your CSV file paths are correct
- For shape mismatch errors, verify your CSV files have the required columns

8. Deactivate Virtual Environment (when done):
        deactivate

Notes:
- The model uses a 2-hidden-layer MLP with ReLU activation
- Training uses mini-batch gradient descent
- Default hyperparameters:
- Learning rate: 0.001
- Batch size: 64
- Epochs: 1000
- You can modify these in the script if needed
